###Overview

One of the mose useful `data types` in JavaScript to store values is an Object.  Objects use key/value pairs (in JS the `key` is called a `property`) to access and store values. 

Often, you will hear that `Arrays` and `Functions` are special object types.  The following Test Specs will demonstrate how `Arrays` and `Functions` have many of the same characteristics as an Object Literal, since `Arrays` and `Functions` are Objects.
