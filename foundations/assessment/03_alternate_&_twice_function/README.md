# Alternate & Twice Function

## Total Points: 8

## Description:

Create the functions alternate and twice. The `alternate` function returns an object that returns a value every other time it is called.  The `twice` function can only invoke the function passed to it a total of two times.   This should sound a lot like the `once` function but with a twist!
