# Assessment 3 - Express/Mongoose

This is the third assessment of the semester.  We're doing this primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed.  Don't stress out that we will be using this test to judge you in any way except to understand how we can better help you.

Also, we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.  Feel free to use any online resource but don't copy/paste answers to each other or if you find something similar online.

## Resources

The following resources are allowed:

* Any notes you've taken so far.
* Any code you have in your previous projects.
* learn.fullstackacademy.com.
* All the slide decks that we've used in class.

## Things we're testing

* Express App Structures 
* Express Routing and Route Methods
* Mongoose Model Configuration

## Starting

1. Fork this repository to your own Github user account.
2. Clone this fork to your local machine.
3. `npm install`
4. Make sure your MongoDB database is running!
5. You can run `npm test` which will continuously run the test suite upon file updates.
6. Read through the project structure, you'll be primarily working in `models/article.js` and  `routes/index.js` in that order. 
7. Start working through the tests in `test/`.  You have to mark them as active (from pending) by changing `xit` to `it`
8. `git commit` often as you make progress on the tests.

These tests include [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

2.  Download the zip of your project from Github.
3.  Email the zip with a link to your repository to `instructors+assessment@fullstackacademy.com` before the time assigned as the end of the assessment.
